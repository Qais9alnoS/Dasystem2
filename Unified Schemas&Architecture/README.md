# Unified Schemas & Architecture Documentation

This folder contains a comprehensive collection of all architectural diagrams, database schemas, API documentation, and implementation details for the School Management System project. The documentation has been organized into logical categories to facilitate easy navigation and understanding.

## Status: âœ… COMPLETE

All content from both the original 'Schemas&Architecture' and 'DAS Backend/README' folders has been successfully merged into this unified structure. Duplicate files have been removed and files with unique content have been preserved.

## Final Directory Structure

### Architecture

Contains backend architecture documentation including technology stack, project structure, core components, and system design principles.

### Schemas

Contains database schema definitions including table structures, relationships, and constraints for both the original specification and the DAS implementation.

### API

Contains API documentation including endpoint specifications, request/response formats, authentication flows, and integration guides.

### Documentation

Contains general documentation including README files, user experience guidelines, and integration guides.

### Implementation

Contains implementation details including development plans, comprehensive analysis, and completion status reports.

### Integration

Contains integration guides for both frontend and backend components, including enhanced documentation for the DAS implementation.

## File Naming Convention

Files are named to indicate their origin:

- Files with "Original" in the name refer to the initial project specification
- Files with "DAS" in the name refer to the DAS Backend implementation
- Files without these qualifiers are unique to either source or are unified documents

## Purpose

This unified documentation serves as a complete reference for understanding:

1. The original project requirements and specifications
2. The implemented DAS Backend solution
3. The differences and enhancements made during implementation
4. The complete system architecture and design

This documentation is intended for developers, system administrators, and stakeholders who need to understand the complete system architecture and implementation details.

See [FINAL_SUMMARY.md](FINAL_SUMMARY.md) for details on the consolidation process and verification that all content has been completely merged.
