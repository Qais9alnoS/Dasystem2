## Project Overview

The School Management System is a comprehensive FastAPI-based web application designed to manage all aspects of a school's operations. It provides functionality for managing students, teachers, academic programs, schedules, finances, activities, and system administration.

### Key Features
- Student management with personal information, academic records, and financial tracking
- Teacher management with assignments, attendance, and payroll
- Academic year and class management
- Schedule generation and management
- Financial tracking for students and the institution
- Activity management including trips, sports, and cultural events
- System administration with user roles and permissions
- Security features including authentication, authorization, and audit logging
- Backup and restore functionality
- Reporting and analytics capabilities

## Architecture

The system follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

```

```

## Main Application Files

### main.py
The main application file initializes the FastAPI application and sets up all necessary components:

- Creates the FastAPI app instance with title, description, and version
- Sets up database tables using SQLAlchemy
- Configures middleware including CORS, rate limiting, and security headers
- Registers all API routers with appropriate prefixes and tags
- Implements startup and shutdown events for service initialization
- Provides health check and root endpoints
- Creates default admin user on startup

Key features:
- Rate limiting integration with custom handlers
- Comprehensive exception handling
- Security middleware for headers and CORS
- Static file serving for uploads
- Database schema initialization

### config.py
Manages application configuration through environment variables:

- Database URL configuration
- Security settings (secret key, algorithm, token expiration)
